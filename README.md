# space-age-obj-c

### Challenge
Your challenge today is to write an Objective-C program that, given an age in seconds, can calculate how old someone would be on:

Earth: orbital period 365.25 Earth days, or 31557600 seconds

Mercury: orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years

Venus: orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years

Mars: orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years

Jupiter: orbital period 11.862615 Earth years

Saturn: orbital period 29.447498 Earth years

Uranus: orbital period 84.016846 Earth years

Neptune: orbital period 164.79132 Earth years

1,000,000,000 seconds == 31.69 Earth years.

**But where's Pluto you [ask?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_2gbGXzFbs).**
